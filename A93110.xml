            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </label> this, that he came not then when he came firſt into the world to judge or puniſh men for ſin, but to ſave men from ſin, and for that purpoſe then, rather to execute his prieſtly and propheticall office then his kingly office in the judgment and puniſhment of ſinners, which is to be done at the time of his ſecond comming to judgment.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this we anſwer, that the ſence of this place is by Interpreters thus, that the beleever ſhall not be judged to condemnation, but in the judgment of abſolution he ſhall be judged. And as for the unbeleever he is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already by that ancient ſentence <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. 2. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. he is condemned alſo by Gods councell and decree, by Gods word and by his own conſcience, the ſentence is as it were paſſed, the halter about his neck, nothing to be done but turn him over the ladder of life, and he is gone for ever. Or he is as ſure to be condemned as if it were done already: but the full and ſolemn declaration and execution of this is not till this laſt judgment.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall come to the application of this point and conſider what profitable uſes we may make thereof wherein we muſt premiſe theſe things, that ſome of the uſes are deduced from the generall doctrine of the laſt judgment, and ſome of them from ſome particular branches of this doctrine, or ſome things that do accompany this judgement; As the firing of the world, the end of all things and the like: And ſome of the uſes are applyable to all men, but ſome to good men and ſome to bad men only.</p>

Who ſhall be Judge? The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, as to the externall viſible act, is to be the Judge of quick and dead. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. 10. 42. And herein his divinity and humanity both ſhall be exerciſed. But as to the conſent and authority the whole Trinity ſhall be Judge. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. Chriſt Jeſus the ſecond perſon of the Trinity is to be the Judge. 1. That as he was judged by the world ſo the world may be judged by him. 2.
